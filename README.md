 # Weather Data Analysis
 ## Project overview

 Analyzing the weather pattern across a whole month and discovering insights

 ---

### Objective

 Deriving insights and being able to predict the future weather changes

### Preparation 

 The data was recieved as a spreadsheets file

### process

 - Discovered the data to be able to generate insights
 - All the variables were changed to appropriate formats
 - The data was rearranged to make it ready for analysis

### Analyze

- Using differnt functions i was able to generate some valuable insights
- utilized the different packeges in python such as 'pandas' and 'numpy'

### Share 

Using tableau i was able to generate the following visiualization

### Action 

- it seems to be an inversly proportional relationship between wind speed and visibility
- Humidity hits an all time high in January and in first quarter generaly
- as usual the the temperature hits it's peak at july or the 3rd quarter generaly
- on thing that remained constant is the urgent need of planting trees to conter the increased wind speed, high temperatures and humidity
